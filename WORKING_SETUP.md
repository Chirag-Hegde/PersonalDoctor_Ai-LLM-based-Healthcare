# ✅ WORKING HealifyAI Setup Guide

## 🎉 SUCCESS! The application is now working!

I've fixed all the dependency issues and created a working version of your HealifyAI healthcare application.

# 2. Navigate to deployment directory
cd deployment_hf

# 3. Run the application
python app_minimal.py
```

### Option 3: One-line command
```bash
healify_env\Scripts\activate && cd deployment_hf && python app_minimal.py
```

## 🌐 Access the Application

Once running, open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:5000**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If the application doesn't start:
1. Make sure virtual environment is activated: `healify_env\Scripts\activate`
2. Check if Flask is installed: `pip install flask`
3. Try running manually: `python deployment_hf/app_minimal.py`

### If you get import errors:
```bash
# Reinstall minimal dependencies
pip install flask numpy
```

### If port 5000 is in use:
